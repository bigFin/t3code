# Provider architecture

> For maintainers. Using T3 Code? See [docs/user](../user/).

A provider is the agent runtime that does the actual work. T3 Code supports several, and the
orchestration layer does not know which one is behind a thread.

## Built-in drivers

[`builtInDrivers.ts`][drivers] exports `BUILT_IN_DRIVERS` with five entries:

| Driver kind   | Driver source                           |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `codex`       | [`Drivers/CodexDriver.ts`][codex]       |
| `claudeAgent` | [`Drivers/ClaudeDriver.ts`][claude]     |
| `cursor`      | [`Drivers/CursorDriver.ts`][cursor]     |
| `grok`        | [`Drivers/GrokDriver.ts`][grok]         |
| `opencode`    | [`Drivers/OpenCodeDriver.ts`][opencode] |

Each driver declares its `driverKind`, a `configSchema`, and a `create` function that builds an
adapter in a child scope. Adapter implementations live beside them in
`apps/server/src/provider/Layers/` (`CodexAdapter.ts`, `ClaudeAdapter.ts`, and so on) and conform to
[`ProviderAdapter.ts`][adapter]. Read the driver plus its adapter to see how a specific agent's
transport, config, and event shapes are mapped.

## Registry and routing

Two registries separate configuration from live processes:

- [`ProviderInstanceRegistry`][instances] keys configured instances by `ProviderInstanceId`. Creating
  one looks up the driver by `driverKind`, decodes `entry.config` with that driver's schema, opens a
  child scope, and calls `driver.create`.
- [`ProviderAdapterRegistry`][registry] resolves an instance ID to its live adapter via
  `getByInstance`.

[`ProviderService`][service] sits on top. It combines the adapter registry with the provider session
directory to route session and turn operations for a thread, so callers name a thread, not an agent.

Adding a driver means writing the driver plus adapter and adding it to `BUILT_IN_DRIVERS`. No
orchestration, contract, or client change is required for the common case.

## How provider work is requested

Clients never call a provider directly. They dispatch orchestration commands over the RPC method
`orchestration.dispatchCommand`, defined with the rest of the orchestration surface in
[`orchestration.ts`][contracts]. The client-dispatchable provider-facing commands are
`thread.turn.start`, `thread.turn.interrupt`, `thread.approval.respond`,
`thread.user-input.respond`, `thread.checkpoint.revert`, and `thread.session.stop`, plus the mode
setters `thread.runtime-mode.set` and `thread.interaction-mode.set`.

The engine persists an event for the command, and a server-side reactor performs the provider call.
Provider output comes back as internal commands such as `thread.message.assistant.delta` and
`thread.session.set`, which clients observe through `orchestration.subscribeThread`. See
[overview.md](./overview.md) for the command/event loop.

## Server-side workers

Provider work flows through three queue-backed workers. All three are built with
`makeDrainableWorker` from [`DrainableWorker.ts`][worker] and expose `drain` for deterministic test
synchronization.

1. [`ProviderRuntimeIngestion`][ingest] consumes provider runtime streams and emits orchestration
   commands.
2. [`ProviderCommandReactor`][cmd] reacts to orchestration intent events and dispatches provider
   calls.
3. [`CheckpointReactor`][checkpoint] captures workspace checkpoints on turn start and completion, and
   performs reverts.

### Buffered assistant delivery

A thread in `buffered` assistant delivery mode accumulates assistant text instead of streaming each
delta. The buffer is not held until turn completion. In [`ProviderRuntimeIngestion`][ingest],
`MAX_BUFFERED_ASSISTANT_CHARS` is 24,000: the append that would exceed it invalidates the buffer and
spills the whole accumulated text as one delta. The buffer also flushes at interaction boundaries,
when a request opens (approval) or user input is requested, via
`flushBufferedAssistantMessagesForTurn`.

## Detached Codex execution

Codex uses a detached provider host so an agent turn is not owned by the T3 server process. The host
owns one Codex app-server process and multiplexes lightweight thread attachments over a Unix socket.
T3 shutdown closes those attachments; it does not stop Codex. An explicit user stop still sends the
provider-host stop command.

Attachments request bounded event replay and then receive a fresh snapshot, so missed transcript
events land before the authoritative state is projected as `session.state.changed`, including an
explicit active turn id (or `null`). Startup events emitted while the first attachment creates its
runtime are synchronized into that replay before the snapshot. If the requested cursor predates the
retained window, the host reports truncation and T3 projects a runtime warning instead of silently
claiming complete replay.

Provider event command ids are stable across replay, so reconnecting T3 does not duplicate already
persisted orchestration changes. Transport commands reuse their id while retrying against the same
provider host. This lets orchestration replace stale projected state without inventing a new
`turn.started` event or prompting the model.

On server startup, [`ProviderSessionReaper`][reaper] reattaches bindings marked with detached session
persistence. A successful reattachment immediately projects the returned `connecting`, `ready`,
`running`, `error`, or `closed` state. Transient transport failures remain visibly reconnecting and
are retried without stopping the provider or aging the binding out through inactivity cleanup. A
typed missing-session result marks the detached execution as no longer present. T3 does not
automatically resume the persisted provider thread, submit a follow-up prompt, or claim that an
interrupted turn continued.

The generated systemd user service uses `KillMode=process`: restarting the T3 service stops its main
server process without killing provider hosts that intentionally continue in the service cgroup.
